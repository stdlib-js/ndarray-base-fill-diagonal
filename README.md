    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# fillDiagonal

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Fill a specified diagonal of a matrix (or stack of matrices) with a scalar value.

<section class="intro">

For an `M`-by-`N` matrix `A`, the `k`-th diagonal is defined as

<!-- <equation class="equation" label="eq:diagonal_definition" align="center" raw="D_k = \{\, A_{i,j} : j - i = k \,\}" alt="Definition of the k-th diagonal of a matrix."> -->

```math
D_k = \{\, A_{i,j} : j - i = k \,\}
```

    <br>
</div> -->

<!-- </equation> -->

where `k = 0` corresponds to the main diagonal, `k > 0` corresponds to the super-diagonals (above the main diagonal), and `k < 0` corresponds to the sub-diagonals (below the main diagonal).

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/ndarray-base-fill-diagonal
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var fillDiagonal = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-base-fill-diagonal' );
```

#### fillDiagonal( x, value, dims, k )

Fills a specified diagonal of a matrix (or stack of matrices) with a scalar value.

```javascript
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-zeros' );

var x = zeros( [ 3, 3 ] );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ], [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ], [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ] ]

var out = fillDiagonal( x, 1.0, [ 0, 1 ], 0 );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 ], [ 0.0, 1.0, 0.0 ], [ 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 ] ]

var bool = ( out === x );
// returns true
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **x**: input ndarray.
-   **value**: scalar value.
-   **dims**: dimension indices defining the plane in which to fill the diagonal.
-   **k**: diagonal offset.

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The order of the dimension indices contained in `dims` matters. The first element specifies the row-like dimension. The second element specifies the column-like dimension.
-   Each provided dimension index must reside on the interval `[-ndims, ndims-1]`.
-   The diagonal offset `k` is interpreted as `column - row`. Accordingly, when `k = 0`, the function fills the main diagonal; when `k > 0`, the function fills the diagonal above the main diagonal; and when `k < 0`, the function fills the diagonal below the main diagonal.
-   If `value` is a number and `x` has a complex [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes], the function fills an input ndarray with a complex number whose real component equals the provided scalar `value` and whose imaginary component is zero.
-   A `value` must be able to safely cast to the input ndarray [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes]. Scalar values having floating-point data types (both real and complex) are allowed to downcast to a lower precision data type of the same kind (e.g., a scalar double-precision floating-point number can be used to fill a `'float32'` input ndarray).
-   The function **mutates** the input ndarray in-place.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-zeros' );
var ndarray2array = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-to-array' );
var fillDiagonal = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-base-fill-diagonal' );

// Create a stack of matrices:
var x = zeros( [ 2, 3, 3 ] );

// Fill main diagonals:
fillDiagonal( x, 1.0, [ 1, 2 ], 0 );
console.log( ndarray2array( x ) );

// Fill super-diagonals:
fillDiagonal( x, 2.0, [ 1, 2 ], 1 );
console.log( ndarray2array( x ) );

// Fill sub-diagonals:
fillDiagonal( x, 3.0, [ 1, 2 ], -1 );
console.log( ndarray2array( x ) );
```
